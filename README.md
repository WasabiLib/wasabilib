#WasabiLib ZF2 Ajax Module
WasabiLib is a ready-to-use ajax module. 
You do not need to write a single line JavaScript code to create ajax requests and responses. 
With the PHP ajax classes you have complete control of the DOM from server-side. 


It comes with ready-to-use components. Most important are:

**1. InnerHtml** - replace, append or remove HTML snippets from HTML elements.  http://www.wasabilib.org/application/pages/examples#inner_html

**2. DomManipulator** - manipulates existing elements. http://www.wasabilib.org/application/pages/examples#dom_manipulator

**3. TriggerEventManager** - trigger JavaScript events from within the PHP code  http://www.wasabilib.org/application/pages/examples#trigger_event_manager

And a lot of extensions based on these components

##Requirements
For a full integration the following assets are needed:
jQuery, Bootstrap, FontAwesome

##Installation
